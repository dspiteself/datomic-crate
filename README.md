# datomic-crate

A Clojure library designed to work with pallet 0.8.0 and create a datomic instance.  This instance has been tested on Ubuntu and RHEL with the free version of datomic.  I don't believe there is anything preventing it from working with non-free versions but I don't have one so don't know the process. Pull requests are welcomed. 
<b>It is expected that you have java installed on the machine already.</b>

This crate will 
* Download datomic based upon the type and version
* Unzip datomic into /opt/local/datomic/<version>
* Update a soft link /opt/local/datomic/current -> /opt/local/datomic/version
* Install the upstart service.  (It will NOT run the service)

## Continuous Integration Status

### The Most Recent Release
With Leiningen
```clojure
  [org.clojars.strad/datomic-crate "0.8.7"]
```

With Maven
```xml
   <dependency>
      <groupId>org.clojars.strad</groupId>
      <artifactId>datomic-crate</artifactId>
      <version>0.8.7</version>
   </dependency>
```

## Server Spec
The datomic crate defines the datomic function, that takes a settings map and returns a server-spec for installing datomic.  You can use this in a `group-spec` or `server-spec`.

```clj
(group-spec "my-node-with-datomic"
   :extends [(pallet.crate.datomic/server-spec {})])
```

## Settings
The datomic crate uses the folowing settings...

```clj
(def ^{:dynamic true} *default-settings*
  {
   :version "0.8.4020.26"
   :type "free"
   :user "datomic"
   :supervisor :upstart
   :service-name "datomic"
   :verify false ;; Don't verify the conf script
   :group "datomic"
   :config-path "/etc/datomic"
   :config {:protocol "free", :host "localhost" :port "4334"
            :data-dir "/var/lib/datomic/data"
            :log-dir "/var/log/datomic"}})
```

`:version`
Version number of datomic to use 

`:type`
The version to use.  One of `#{"free"}`.  This is only used to figure out what version should be downloaded.

`:user`
The user to install the datomic service and code as.  Defaults to `"datomic"`.

`:group`
The group to install the datomic service and code as.  Defaults to `"datomic"`.

`:config-path`
The location of the config file.  Defaults to `"/etc/datomic"`. The file name would then be /etc/datomic/transactor.properties.

`:config`
The data to save to the config-file.

### Config (used for the :config key)
`:protocol`
The protocol to use.  Defaults to `"free`"

`:host`
The host to use.  Defaults to `"localhost"`

`:port`
The port to use.  Defaults to `"4334`"

`:data-dir`
The data directory to save the dbs to.  Defaults to `"/var/lib/datomic/data"`

`:log-dir`
The log directory to save the logs to.  Defaults to `"/var/log/datomic"`

`:memory-index-max`
Optional.  Defaults to no key and no value. (i.e. nothing is written to the config file)
